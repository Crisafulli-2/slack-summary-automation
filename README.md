# Slack Google Sheets Integration

## Status

- Flask app and ngrok tunnel are running.
- Slack app is installed, subscribed to `message.channels` and `message.im` events, and invited to the channel.
- Endpoint `/slack/events` is verified by Slack.
- **Current issue:** Messages sent in Slack are not appearing in the Flask terminal as expected.

## Where We Left Off

- The event handler (`src/slack_events.py`) is set up to print all incoming event data.
- No debug output appears when sending messages in Slack, despite correct setup.

## Next Steps

1. Double-check that the Slack Event Subscription URL is set to your current ngrok URL with `/slack/events` at the end.
2. Make sure both ngrok and Flask are running and using the correct ports.
3. Confirm the bot is in the channel and has the required permissions.
4. Check for any errors in the Flask or ngrok terminal when sending messages.
5. Continue debugging event delivery from Slack.
